# Full-Stack Pairing

This is the starter-code for our full-stack pairing assessment. This project is split into two directories:

- `api/` is the Ruby on Rails API server.
- `console/` is the React/TS frontend.

The API comes with the following models:

| Model        | Description                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Chatroom`   | Chatrooms represent conversations with 9-1-1 callers during an emergency.  |
| `NatureCode` | Nature codes represent categories that describe the nature of a 9-1-1 call |

The API has also been set up with GraphQL.

- All requests will go through the `POST /graphql` route

- You can test the graphql operations by visiting `/graphiql`. You can use tools like [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)
  or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), or `cURL`

The API has been set up with [`graphql-ruby`](https://graphql-ruby.org/), and the console has been set up with [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react), [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/usage/) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).

## Assignment

### Gotchas

Before you get started, here are a few things to remember:

- This project uses `GraphQL` and it set up to automatically generate TS types and functions from `.graphql` files
  - All GraphQL operations are defined in `console/src/graphql/operations` with `.graphql` files
  - If you create a new `.graphql` file, remember to run `yarn codegen`!
  - You can find some examples of React hooks generated by `yarn codegen` in the [`ChatroomPage`](console/src/modules/chatroom/ChatroomsPage.tsx) and the [`CreateChatroomModal`](console/src/modules/chatroom/CreateChatroomModal.tsx)
- This project uses Material UI's [`Box`](https://mui.com/system/react-box/) component which relies on MUI's [`sx` prop](https://mui.com/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/).
  - This can be useful for providing consistent styling according to the project's theme
  - Feel free to use `Box`, other MUI components, or, create a CSS file. It's entirely up to you!
- This project contains examples of how to do everything that is required as part of the assignment.
  - If you can't find what you're looking for in the documentation of the tools used in this project, try looking through the repo for some examples!

Alright, let's get started! ðŸš€

### Part 1 - Resolving Chatrooms

Users should be able to resolve chatrooms.

- Add a "Resolve" button to chatroom list items
- Clicking on the "Resolve" button should prompt the user to confirm they want to resolve the chatroom
- If confirmed, the chatroom's `archived` field should be updated to `true` and should be removed from the chatrooms page

**NOTE:** You'll need to modify Apollo's cache to remove the chatroom from the chatrooms page. Instead of modifying the cache, you can use Apollo's [`refetchQueries`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations/#refetching-queries) feature. Here's an [example](console/src/modules/chatroom/CreateChatroomModal.tsx) of `refetchQueries` being used with a mutation.

### Part 2 - Fix Updating Nature Codes

Some users have reported an issue with updating a Chatroom's nature code.

To reproduce the bug:

- Expand a chatroom in the chatrooms list
- Select a new nature code using the select input on the right
- Confirm that the nature code does not update properly

Find the bug and fix it!

## Expectations

- Correctness and completeness of the implemented features.
- Code quality, including readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
- Proper use of Ruby on Rails, GraphQL, React, and TypeScript.
- Error handling and validation.

## Getting Started

### Running the API

Make sure you have [ruby installed](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)!

#### Installation + Set Up

First, let's install all of the necessary dependencies

```sh
cd api
bundle install
```

Next, let's set up the database

```sh
cd api
bundle exec rails db:migrate db:seed
```

Finally, we can run the server!

```sh
cd api
bundle exec rails s
```

#### Running Tests

```sh
cd api
bundle exec rspec
```

### Running the console

This project uses [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable), so make sure you've got it installed!

#### Installation + Set Up

First, let's install all of the necessary dependencies

```sh
cd console
yarn install
```

All we need to do now is run the dev server!

```sh
cd console
yarn start
```
